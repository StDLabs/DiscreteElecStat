# DiscreteElecStat

One of the fundamental problems in computational electrostatics involves computing and visualizing electrostatic fields
generated by arbitrary configurations of point charges in space. Due to a variety and complexity of input parameters and
requirements, computations can be highly encumbered.

This repository offers a quick exposition of key abilities of my main MathTools library to effectively generate and
visualize described electrostatic fields due to discrete configurations of point charges.

## Spatial structures and crystal lattices

There are several obstacles to overcome, but the first will involve the complexity of the point charges configuration,
which can be a multipole, periodic spatial lattice or a more complex functional rule-based configuration.

I would like to show two structures that differ in complexity: a simple electric dipole and an interplanar area of
a perfect crystalline lattice with triclinic symmetry (parallelepipedal cells). The triclinic crystal system is the most
general crystal system, characterized by three axes of unequal lengths that intersect at oblique angles, resulting in
a unit cell shaped like a parallelepiped.
