# DiscreteElecStat

One of the fundamental problems in **computational electrostatics** involves computing and visualizing **electrostatic
fields** generated by **arbitrary configurations** of **point charges** in space. Due to a variety and complexity of
input parameters and requirements, computations can be highly encumbered.

This repository offers a **quick exposition** of **key abilities** of my
main [**MathTools**](https://github.com/StDLabs/MathTools) library to effectively generate and
visualize described electrostatic fields due to discrete configurations of point charges.

## Spatial structures and crystal lattices

There are several obstacles to overcome, but the first will involve the complexity of the point charges
**configuration**, which can be a **multipole**, **periodic spatial lattice** or a more complex
**functional rule-based configuration**.

I would like to show two structures that differ in complexity: a simple **electric dipole** and an interplanar area of
a **perfect crystalline lattice** with **triclinic symmetry** (parallelepipedal cells). The triclinic crystal system is
the most general crystal system, characterized by three axes of unequal lengths that intersect at oblique angles,
resulting in a unit cell shaped like a parallelepiped.
